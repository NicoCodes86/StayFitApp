Downloading And Running The Project Locally On FS Dev Machine
This project is an open source project designed to encourage people to stay fit! It's really that simple. We put this project together in 2 weeks as a final project at Kingsland University. Our network of peers are a well-connected bunch whom we invite to contribute to our project as much as web development community. All ideas welcome as we continue to enhance our website.
The code as is NOT meant for the general public, but rather for people with knowledge of:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
REACT
Node & Node.js
Express
MongoDB & Mongoose
Figma
Mui
First thing to do is clone the repo locally on a Full Stack development system with the following command:
git clone https://github.com/NicoCodes86/stayFitApp.git
To help keep this code system independent, system specific packages are not included in the repo but need to be pulled into the code base in order to run the code. So the next step is to pull in the proper package dependencies in both the "client" and "server" side. From the projects base directory switch to both the "client" and "server" directories separate, i.e. the command needs to be done twice, and then type the following command from within a VSCode terminal command view:
npm install
Again, this command needs to be done twice, once in the client directory, and again in the back-end directory.
In the VSCode terminal from the project base directory "..../ku_fs_q4_2021_fp_stayFitApp/" create a split terminal view so that there are two separate terminal views.
In one of the terminal views type the follwoing commands:
cd server npm start
In the other terminal view type the following commands:
cd client npm start
At this point, the Back-End (server) is running and the Front-End (client) is running and a browser view will automatically come up.
Thanks for taking the time to review and consider our project worthy of your time!
Sincerely,
Paolo, Taren, Josh, and Rahul
